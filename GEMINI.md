## Project Overview

This directory contains the source code and documentation for the "LLM Data Analyzer" tool, a command-line utility for analyzing large text and JSONL files using Large Language Models.

## Development Rules

1.  **Specification-Driven Development:** All development must adhere to the specifications and development plan outlined in the `SPEC.md` document.
2.  **Plan Synchronization:** If any changes to the plan or specifications are necessary during development, the `SPEC.md` document must be updated accordingly to ensure documentation and implementation remain synchronized.
3.  **Concurrent Unit Testing:** Unit tests must be implemented concurrently with any new feature implementation or modification.
4.  **Testable Design:** All code must be designed with testability in mind, for example by using techniques like dependency injection, to facilitate effective unit testing.
